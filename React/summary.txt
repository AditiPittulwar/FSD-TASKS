-----------------------------------------------REACT.JS------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFINATION:- React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook (now Meta) for building user interfaces, 
especially single-page applications (SPAs). It helps developers create reusable UI components that efficiently 
update when data changes.

React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) using a component-based architecture 
and a virtual Document Object Model (DOM) for efficient rendering. It is developed and maintained by Meta 
(formerly Facebook) and a large community of developers and is popular for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).


 Key Features:-


 (a) Component-Based Architecture

Definition: React applications are built using components, which are independent, reusable pieces of UI.

Purpose: Each component controls its own logic and appearance.

Types of Components:

Functional Components: Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.

Class Components: Older style components using ES6 classes and lifecycle methods.

Example:
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}


(b) JSX (JavaScript XML)

Definition: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript files.

Purpose: Makes code easier to read and understand.

Example:
const element = <h1>Welcome to React</h1>;


(c) Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)

Definition: The Virtual DOM is an in-memory copy of the actual DOM that React uses to track changes.

How it works:

React keeps a virtual representation of the UI.

When a component’s state changes, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (Diffing Algorithm).

Only the changed elements are updated in the real DOM.

Benefit: This makes React fast and efficient compared to direct DOM manipulation.


(d) Declarative Programming

Definition: React uses a declarative style, meaning you describe what the UI should look like for a given state, not how to change it.

Example:
const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false);
return <p>{loggedIn ? "Welcome!" : "Please log in"}</p>;


(e) Unidirectional Data Flow

Definition: Data in React flows in one direction — from parent to child components through props.

Purpose: Ensures predictable data handling and easier debugging.

Example:
function Child(props) {
  return <p>{props.message}</p>;
}

function Parent() {
  return <Child message="Hello from Parent" />;
}


(f) State and Props

State:

Data managed within a component (mutable).

Changes in state trigger a re-render.

Example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

Props (Properties):

Read-only data passed from parent to child components.

Example:
<Greeting name="Aditi" />


(g) React Hooks

Definition: Functions that let you “hook into” React’s features in functional components.

Common Hooks:

useState() – For managing local component state.

useEffect() – For handling side effects like fetching data or manipulating the DOM.

useContext() – For accessing global data without prop drilling.

Example:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  });

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>;
}

 (h) Lifecycle Methods


Definition: Special methods that get called at different stages of a 
component’s life (Mounting, Updating, Unmounting).


Example (Class Components):


componentDidMount() → Runs after the component is added to the DOM.


componentDidUpdate() → Runs after updates.


componentWillUnmount() → Runs before the component is removed.



(Hooks like useEffect replicate these in functional components.)

 (i) React Router


Definition: A library for navigation and routing in React apps.


Purpose: Helps switch between pages without reloading the whole page.


Example:
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>




 (j) Redux (State Management Library)


Definition: A predictable state management 
tool used with React for handling complex app data.


Concepts:


Store: Central place where all app data is kept.


Actions: Describe what you want to do.


Reducers: Define how the state changes based on actions.




(k) React Native


Definition: A framework built on React for building mobile apps (Android/iOS)
 using JavaScript and React syntax.



 3. Advantages of React.js

 Fast and efficient due to Virtual DOM
 Component reusability saves time
 Easy to debug and maintain
 Large community and ecosystem
 Can be used for web and mobile apps


 4. Common Use Cases

----------------------------------------What is JSX?---------------------------------------


 JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.js to describe what the UI should look like.

It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript — React then converts this JSX into normal JavaScript that the 
browser understands.

Example:

Without JSX (pure JavaScript):

const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');


With JSX (simpler and cleaner):

const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;


 Both do the same thing, but JSX is easier to read and write.

 How JSX Works

JSX is not directly understood by browsers.
When you run your React app, Babel (a compiler) converts JSX into JavaScript.

For example:

const element = <h1>Hello</h1>;


is transformed into:

const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");

 JSX Rules

Must have one root element

 Invalid
return (
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
);

 Correct
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </div>
);


Use className instead of class

<div className="container"></div>


JavaScript expressions go inside {}

const name = "Aditi";
return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;


Attributes in JSX use camelCase

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

 Why Use JSX?

  Easier to visualize UI structure
  Mix HTML + JS logic in one place
  Faster development
  Helps with error checking via Babel

 Example React Component Using JSX
function Welcome() {
  const user = "Aditi";
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user}!</h1>
      <p>This is JSX in action </p>
    </div>
  );
}
